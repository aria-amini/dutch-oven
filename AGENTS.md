# TanStack application template

This is a full-stack TanStack Start application using React 19, Vite+, Drizzle,
Postgres, Better Auth, Tailwind v4, shadcn, and Varlock. Local services are
provided by Docker Compose (Postgres and MinIO). The dev server runs as a
pitchfork daemon (see `pitchfork.toml`) that auto-starts/stops when entering or
leaving the directory; each jj workspace gets unique ports via
`mise-tasks/setup.ts` (run by `mise run bootstrap`; re-run anytime with
`mise run setup`).

Google sign-in uses one shared dev OAuth client (type "Desktop app", so any
loopback port works) hardcoded in `.env.schema`. Deployed environments get
dedicated credentials via `.env.deployed`.

Error monitoring is wired through Sentry (`@sentry/tanstackstart-react`).

Product analytics run through PostHog behind a `/api/ingest` proxy.

## Commands

- `vp dev` — start development (usually managed by pitchfork instead)
- `pitchfork list` / `pitchfork logs dev` / `pitchfork tui` — inspect the dev
  daemon
- `vp check` — format, lint, and type-check
- `vp test run` — run Vitest projects
- `vp run e2e` — run Playwright smoke tests
- `vp run compose:up` — start local services
- `vp run db:push` — apply the current schema
- `vp run db:migrate` — run migrations
- `vp run dead-code` — find unused exports with fallow

Use `pnpm` through Vite+ (`vp i`, `vp run <script>`). Secrets and environment
values resolve through Varlock; do not commit generated or local secret files.
